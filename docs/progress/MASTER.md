## Current Status

**Active Phase**: Complete locally.
**Active Task**: None. Remaining external reconciliation is push/remote issue closure after the local stack is reviewed.
**Blockers**: Android APK/Gradle validation is blocked on this machine because `java -version` reports no Java Runtime. `npm run android:assemble:debug` stops at the explicit JDK check.

## Governance Status

**Shared instruction surface**: `AGENTS.md`, auto-generated from Claude project memory. Do not hand-edit for durable rules unless the sync source is also updated.
**Claude Code instruction surface**: no root `CLAUDE.md`; `.claude/settings.local.json` exists.
**Other platform rule surfaces**: `.codex/skills/` exists but has no project skill files; no Cursor/Windsurf/Cline rules found.
**Memory surface**: Codex native memory.
**Memory fallback path**: none. Do not create repo-local fallback memory unless explicitly selected.

## Execution Telemetry

Per-task telemetry should be written to the corresponding GitHub Issue as comments. Adaptive drift state lives in Milestone descriptions under the `adaptive` YAML block.

## Notes

- Better DeepSeek reference snapshot: `EdgeTypE/better-deepseek` commit `450168e` from 2026-06-09.
- Do not copy Better DeepSeek's BDS tag system wholesale. New capabilities should map to DeepSeek++ ToolDescriptor, prompt augmentation, platform, and renderer contracts.
- Android is in scope, but validation must be explicit: TypeScript tests, Gradle/Kotlin tests, APK build, and emulator/WebView smoke are separate evidence levels.
- Previous active multilingual runtime support spec artifacts were complete and archived locally under `docs/archives/multilingual-english-runtime-support/`; milestones #26-#30 are closed.

## Next Steps

1. Push the local `main` stack when ready.
2. After push, reconcile GitHub Issues #152-#181 and Milestones #31-#36 from local implemented state to remote closed state.
3. Install a local JDK before claiming Android APK validation.

## Session Log

| Date | Session | Summary |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 2026-06-11 | Planning | Archived completed multilingual runtime support artifacts, analyzed DeepSeek++ and Better DeepSeek, wrote analysis and plan docs, created GitHub Milestones #31-#36 and Issues #152-#181, and initialized this progress tracker. |
| 2026-06-11 | P0 implementation | Implemented platform contracts, bridge schemas, prompt project-context ordering, renderer registry, Project Context/RAG, artifact file/zip tools, Projects UI, Android WebView scaffold, Android asset staging scripts, and capability gating. Validation passed except Android APK build, which is blocked by missing local JDK. |
| 2026-06-11 | P1 implementation | Implemented sandbox approval cards, browser/Python sandbox handoff, voice settings and sidepanel speech controls, Skill draft review cards, memory import preview with per-item rejection, saved snippets/bookmarks, prompt injection controls, saved-item sync boundaries, and P1 tests. TypeScript compile and all Vitest tests passed. |
| 2026-06-11 | P2 implementation | Implemented DeepSeek history tags/search/filtering, message and saved-item exports, image manifest export format, gated developer API playground, code block downloads, reversible navigation patch, local what's-new panel, and custom CSS/theme policy decision. Full P2 validation matrix passed. |
| 2026-06-11 | Phase 6 hardening/docs | Ran full `ci:quality`, web smoke, Android best-available checks, docs leakage checks, and release asset verification. Updated README, README_EN, Chrome Web Store listing/submission/privacy docs, Android developer docs, and prepared archive state. Android Gradle remains blocked by missing local JDK. |
