# Task Breakdown

## Overview

- **Task definition**: Incorporate the high-value Better DeepSeek capabilities that DeepSeek++ does not currently support, with Android WebView support explicitly in scope.
- **Total Phases**: 6
- **Total Tasks**: 25
- **Estimated Total Effort**: XL
- **Tracking Mode**: `GITHUB_STANDARD`
- **Confirmed Direction**: User delegated prioritization and explicitly called out Android as valuable. Execution still requires the Phase 5 confirmation checkpoint before implementation starts.

## S.U.P.E.R Design Constraints

- **S (Single Purpose)**: Do not add more responsibilities to `entrypoints/content.ts`, `core/interceptor/fetch-hook.ts`, `SettingsPage.tsx`, or `McpPage.tsx` without extracting focused modules first.
- **U (Unidirectional Flow)**: Keep flow as platform adapter -> runtime contract -> core service -> UI renderer. Android-specific behavior must not import browser-only concrete implementations.
- **P (Ports over Implementation)**: Define TypeScript contracts and schemas before implementing project context, artifacts, Android bridge, saved items, voice, and sandbox execution.
- **E (Environment-Agnostic)**: Browser extension, Android WebView, and native messaging are separate platform capabilities. Unsupported combinations must be explicit, visible, and tested.
- **R (Replaceable Parts)**: New capabilities should be replaceable through providers/adapters: project sources, artifact writers, platform services, sandbox runners, and voice engines.

## Testing and Governance Constraints

- Feature work must add or update automated tests.
- Prompt/tool behavior changes must update `prompt:freeze` intentionally.
- Persisted data changes must update schema tests and WebDAV sync boundary tests.
- Android validation must distinguish TypeScript unit tests, Gradle/Kotlin tests, APK build, and emulator/WebView smoke. Do not report Android as validated when the required toolchain is missing.
- Durable implementation rules go to the resolved native memory surface; future-agent rules must be reflected through the canonical instruction sync source, not by hand-editing generated `AGENTS.md`.

## Phase 1: Foundation Contracts and Seams

**Goal**: Establish the architectural ports needed before adding Better-style capabilities.
**Prerequisite**: Phase 1 analysis documents complete.
**S.U.P.E.R Focus**: P, E, R.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On | Lane | S.U.P.E.R | Test Expectation | Memory Impact | Acceptance Criteria |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| T1.1 | Define platform service contracts for storage, runtime messaging, downloads, file picking, asset URLs, and environment capabilities | P0 | M | - | A | P,E,R | Unit tests for browser adapter and capability detection | Record platform capability invariant if accepted | Contracts live under a focused module; browser implementation preserves existing behavior; unsupported capabilities are explicit |
| T1.2 | Add runtime bridge message schemas for MAIN/content/background/platform communication | P0 | M | - | B | P,U | Unit tests for schema accept/reject cases | Record bridge schema convention | Bridge messages are typed and validated; existing request augmentation and tool restore paths still compile and test |
| T1.3 | Define prompt context ordering contract for preset, Skill, memory, project context, and tool instructions | P0 | M | - | C | P,U | Request augmentation tests plus prompt-freeze update | Record prompt ordering invariant | Project context can be inserted later without changing memory/Skill semantics; prompt-freeze catches model-facing drift |
| T1.4 | Extract content card renderer registry from the large content entrypoint | P0 | M | T1.2 | D | S,R | Tests for renderer registration and existing tool block rendering | None unless renderer convention becomes durable | Existing tool cards, export action, and inline agent traces keep behavior; new cards can register without editing unrelated content logic |
| T1.5 | Add minimal browser e2e fixture harness for DOM injections | P1 | M | T1.2,T1.4 | E | P,E | Playwright or equivalent fixture test for content injection against mock DeepSeek DOM | Record e2e command if adopted | Test harness exercises at least one content script card and one request augmentation path |

### Parallel Lanes

| T2.5 | Add generated artifact local tool provider for single-file outputs | P0 | M | T1.2,T1.4 | D | P,R | Tool parser/runtime tests and content card tests | Record artifact safety limits | Model can request a downloadable file through the existing ToolDescriptor path; file names, MIME, and size are validated |
| T2.6 | Add multi-file project bundle workflow equivalent to LONG_WORK | P0 | L | T2.5 | D | S,P,R | Bundle tests, card restore tests, prompt-freeze update | Record artifact bundle contract | Multiple generated files are collected into a zip with visible progress and no raw technical tag leakage |

| T3.2 | Add Kotlin WebView host, asset loader, cookie/login handling, and injection lifecycle | P0 | L | T3.1 | A | E,P | Gradle assemble where toolchain exists; Kotlin unit tests for pure helpers | Record validation caveats | WebView loads DeepSeek, injects bundled scripts, preserves cookies, and handles back navigation |
| T3.3 | Implement Android bridge for storage, downloads, file/folder picking, theme, and locale | P0 | L | T1.1,T3.2 | B | P,E,R | Kotlin unit tests + TypeScript adapter tests | Record bridge security invariant | Android platform adapter passes existing storage/runtime tests; downloads and pickers have clear user-visible errors |
| T3.4 | Add Android capability gating for native messaging, Shell, sidePanel-only UI, and unsupported browser APIs | P0 | M | T3.3 | C | E,R | Capability matrix tests | Record unsupported-capability rule | Android does not show false-ready controls for Shell/native messaging; unsupported features fail loudly and visibly |

| T4.2 | Add optional voice input and response read-aloud | P1 | M | T1.1 | B | S,E | Adapter tests with unsupported browser fallback | None | Users can enable STT/TTS where platform supports it; unsupported platforms show explicit state |
| T4.3 | Add AI-assisted Skill creator tool with review-before-save | P1 | M | T1.2,T2.5 | C | P,U | Tool/runtime/Skill registry tests | Record review-before-save rule if accepted | Model-created skills enter existing custom Skill registry only after user review and name validation |

## Phase 5: P2 Organization, Export, and Product Surfaces

**Goal**: Add lower-priority Better DeepSeek features once the core agentic and Android work is stable.
**Prerequisite**: P0 phases complete.
**S.U.P.E.R Focus**: S, R.

| T5.1 | Add chat tags, filtering, and history search adapters for DeepSeek sidebar | P2 | L | T1.5 | A | S,E | DOM fixture/e2e tests | Record DOM adapter assumptions | Tags/search are isolated from official export and fail visibly if DeepSeek DOM changes |
| T5.2 | Extend export to message-level, saved-item, and image outputs | P2 | M | T4.5 | B | P,R | Export schema/artifact tests | None | Existing official export remains compatible; new formats are optional and clearly labeled |
| T5.3 | Add API playground behind explicit developer/user setting | P2 | M | T1.1 | C | S,P | API key boundary tests and UI tests | Record API key storage rule if needed | Playground uses existing API key boundaries and never leaks keys into sync/export |
| T5.4 | Add small UX polish: code block downloads, native navigation patch, local what's-new panel | P2 | M | T1.5 | D | S,E | DOM fixture tests | None | UX patches are optional, reversible, and covered by selectors/fixtures |
| T5.5 | Decide custom CSS/theme preset policy; implement only if compatible with store/product posture | P2 | S | T1.5 | E | P,E | Not applicable if decision doc only; if implemented, add settings tests | Record policy decision | A documented go/no-go decision exists; no remote CSS or unbounded injection is introduced |
